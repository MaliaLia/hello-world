# hello-world

Greetings everyone,
My name is Malia Machado. I was born in China and adopted when I was one year old. I came to live with my family in Basalt, Colorado until I was 18 when I went off to college in Aptos, California (Cabrillo College). I am now in my senior year of college at California State University, Monterey Bay where I am a NOAA CCME Research Fello in Dr. Nathaniel Jue's Lab. 

I still love dance, music, acting, and art. I just got a new bike and I am very excited about it. Hope to go back to California soon to start doing research again. May even have an opportunity to work with the heath department on COVID-19 related projects and water quality control. 

Talk to you later. 

Best,
Malia Machado
